Training on use of GitHub
I am Gary L. Roach
I have been working with computer of one form or another since the mid 1960's.
I am retired after 40 years working technical fields and am 85 years old.
I have persistant vertigo which really messes up my physical life but doesn't 
precude me from computer work.
I specialize in computer modeling.
I have a BS degree in applied methematics, a minor in theoretical physics and
slightly less than four semesters of electronic engineering.
I am setting this up to try to modify the Elmerfem Helmholtz solver for adaptive
meshing.
